Fix Income Collection Timing in Axis & Allies Campaign

This script corrects the fundamental error where all 6 nations collect income 
after each turn via "income_collection_phases" arrays. It restructures the 
campaign.json to ensure each nation only collects income during their own 
turn as Phase 7.

The correct 1941 turn order is:
1. Germany (collects income only during its turn)
2. Soviet Union (collects income only during its turn)
3. Japan (collects income only during its turn)
4. United Kingdom (collects income only during its turn)
5. Italy (collects income only during its turn)
6. United States (collects income only during its turn)
