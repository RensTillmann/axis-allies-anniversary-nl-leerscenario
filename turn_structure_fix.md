# TURN STRUCTURE FIX NEEDED

## Current Problems:
- Multiple players' phases mixed within same turn number
- German Purchase Phase and Soviet Purchase Phase both labeled "turn 3"
- Combat phases appearing after purchase phases from different players
- Complete violation of 7-phase turn sequence

## Correct 1941 Turn Order:
1. **Turn 1: Germany** (Phases 1-7)
2. **Turn 2: Soviet Union** (Phases 1-7)  
3. **Turn 3: Japan** (Phases 1-7)
4. **Turn 4: United Kingdom** (Phases 1-7)
5. **Turn 5: Italy** (Phases 1-7)
6. **Turn 6: United States** (Phases 1-7)

## 7-Phase Sequence per Turn:
1. Research & Development (optional)
2. Purchase Units
3. Combat Move
4. Conduct Combat
5. Noncombat Move
6. Mobilize New Units
7. Collect Income

## Required Restructuring:
Each chapter needs complete overhaul to separate player turns properly.

Example for Chapter 2:
- Turn 3 (Germany): All phases 1-7
- Turn 4 (USSR): All phases 1-7

This is a major structural issue requiring systematic fix across ALL chapters.
