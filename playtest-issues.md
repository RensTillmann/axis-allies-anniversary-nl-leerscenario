# Campaign Playtest Issues Report

## Overall Assessment: ✅ PLAYABLE
The campaign is successfully playable from start to finish without blocking issues. Players can follow the script and learn game mechanics progressively.

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
1. **Chapter 3 - German IPC Calculation Error**
   - **Location**: `chapters/chapter_03_britain.json`, line ~272
   - **Issue**: German banked total shows 54 IPC but calculation note says "21 previous + 33 collected"
   - **Expected**: Should be 58 (from Chapter 2) + 33 collected = 91 IPC (assuming no purchases in Chapter 3)
   - **Impact**: Mathematical inconsistency affects continuity
   - **Fix Required**: Correct the German banked IPC calculation

### Issues Already Resolved ✅
1. **UK Factory Repair**: Initially appeared to be missing, but Chapter 6 properly addresses this with full tutorial
2. **Turn Structure**: Successfully implemented round_X_turn_Y_phase_Z format throughout
3. **Income Collection**: Fixed to only occur during own Phase 7
4. **National Objectives**: Working correctly from Chapter 4 onward

## Positive Findings

### Excellent Mechanics Coverage ✅
- **Basic Combat**: Chapters 1-2 (movement, dice, territory control)
- **Air Warfare**: Chapter 3 (fighters, strategic bombing, AA guns)
- **Naval Combat**: Chapter 4 (carriers, Pearl Harbor scenario)
- **Tank Blitzing**: Chapter 5 (mobility rules, territorial expansion)
- **Shore Bombardment**: Chapter 5 (amphibious assault mechanics)
- **Research & Development**: Chapter 6 (technology system)
- **Factory Repair**: Chapter 6 (infrastructure investment)
- **Canal Control**: Chapter 7 (Suez, Panama strategic importance)
- **Advanced Submarine Rules**: Chapter 8 (surprise strike, submersible)
- **Complete National Objectives**: Chapter 9 (all nations)
- **Chinese Special Rules**: Chapter 10 (unique mechanics)

### Strong Educational Progression ✅
- **Chapter 1**: "Never leave territory undefended" - demonstrates security vs speed
- **Chapter 2**: Quality vs Quantity doctrines - strategic philosophy comparison
- **Chapter 3**: Air warfare coordination - both sides make same tactical errors
- **Chapter 4**: Overconfidence syndrome - success breeds dangerous expansion
- **Chapter 5**: Multi-front pressure - doctrine limitations exposed
- **Chapter 6**: Technology race and infrastructure investment decisions
- **Chapters 7-10**: Advanced coalition warfare and special rules

### Mathematical Accuracy ✅
- IPC calculations generally correct (except one German error)
- Unit tracking consistent throughout
- Combat dice results mathematically sound
- Victory city counts maintained accurately
- National Objectives bonuses calculated correctly

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Fix Chapter 3 German IPC calculation error

### Medium Priority (Optional Improvements)
1. Add more explicit "decision point" explanations for why certain strategies are chosen
2. Consider adding alternative strategy sidebars for educational comparison
3. Expand technology examples beyond Super Submarines and Radar

### Low Priority (Future Enhancements)
1. Add optional difficulty variations
2. Include more historical context for failed strategies
3. Add "what if" scenarios for different strategic choices

## Conclusion
The campaign successfully achieves its educational objectives and provides a playable experience that teaches Axis & Allies Anniversary Edition mechanics progressively. The one mathematical error should be corrected, but otherwise the campaign is ready for use as an educational tool.
