The word came by telephone—
Axis & Allies® was to be one of three
games to mark the 50th
anniversary of Avalon Hill®.
My mission was clear:
build a game worthy of
this anniversary from the
ground up. I would have
the opportunity to design a
very special Axis & Allies
Anniversary Edition.
First and foremost,
design and provide a
larger game board. Next,
include individual storage
trays the likes of which
had never been seen
before. And what better
occassion to add new
national units like the Chinese and
Italians? As it turned out, this was only
the beginning of many new features.
Why not have a new starting date for
the game? Avalon Hill brand manager
Brian Hart and I discussed a 1939
scenario. This idea came with many
undesirable problems, however. The
game would automatically be much
longer to play. The United States
would not participate in the game for
the fi rst three or four turns. The game
would suffer from a rather slow and
very predictable start. This, and several
other issues, would prove to be too
problematic from a game point of view.
The war did not become truly global
until the Japanese attacked Pearl
Harbor. We fi nally decided that
this infamous date would be our
starting point . . . well almost. As it
turned out, by way of some serious
lobbying from one of my playtest
groups, we concluded that turn one
would include both the Japanese
attack at Pearl Harbor as well as the
German attack on Russia (Operation
Barbarossa). This would really start
the game off with a bang.
To really make it interesting, I wanted
to include a second scenario. The
fi rst scenario would be the 1941
start time (the Axis attack), and the
second would be the traditional 1942
date (the Axis high water mark).
Both would require different set-up
situations. Initial playtesting quickly
discovered that this strategy would
yield two completely different games
in one box and ultimately twice the
work. I wanted to reach out to the
Axis & Allies community for help and
dependable feedback, and so I did.
I was fortunate enough to have the right
playtest groups ready and willing to
volunteer for the job. As it turned out,
these playtesters (see game credits)
were highly experienced veteran
players of the game. As a consequence,
experts from all across the United
States and Europe were testing and
probing for game problems.
One important aspect of the game that
I wanted to address was the ahistorical
tendency for the Japanese to attack
Russia. I did not mind if this attack
occurred late in the game—who
knows, if things had gone differently
during the actual war, perhaps the
Japanese would have attacked Russia.
The solution I settled on was to
add additional territories and units
between the Japanese forces and
Moscow. The real-world translation
of these additional territories is the
seemingly endless miles that exist
between Asia and Moscow.
At some point in the development stage
I stumbled onto an idea . . . “National
Objectives & Bonus Income.” Why
not incorporate into the game the
stated historical objectives of the real
countries involved in the war? If a
controlling player manages to achieve
certain objectives, that player should
be rewarded with bonus income!
For example, the stated objective
declared by Imperial Japan to the rest
of the world was, “The Greater East
Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.” If the
Japanese player manages to achieve
the actual stated Japanese goals, he or
she is rewarded with additional IPCs.
Pursuing objectives that provide midgame income bonuses creates a more
historical game pattern for all. I think
the game now looks and feels more
historical than ever.
The addition of Italy as a power is
something I have wanted to do for a
long time. It certainly is not one of
the major powers, but if played as a
separately controlled power, Italy can
be an important partner of the Axis
alliance. It also nicely rounds off the
numbers and makes this otherwise
fi ve-player game into a six-player
game. Protected by Germany in the
north, Italy can now be the dominant
industrial power in the Mediterranean,
the Middle East, and of course,
Africa.
China, on the other hand, was not
designed to be a self-standing power.
Chinese units will continue to be
controlled by the American player,
but it sure looks and feels like a
separate power.
There are also lots of other changes
that this game brings to the table. For
example, the submarine and transport
rules have been considerably
changed. Also, the basic IPC price
structure for ships has been reduced.
This may make for more ships on
the board. Weapons development
has been reworked as well. It is also
optional in that players can elect to
play with them or not.
Finally, after months of playtesting,
I turned the game over to Wizards of
the Coast®. This was not the end of
the process. The internal Wizards’
design team began their work of fi netuning the monster.
I am excited about this new version
of Axis & Allies. It is indeed worthy
of the honor of marking Avalon Hill’s
50th anniversary. I think it will prove
to be a fascinating new puzzle to solve.

A Note About
The Cover Art
We wanted the Axis & Allies
Anniversary Edition to stand out in
every way possible. So we knew we
needed to have illustrator/artist Jim
Butcher, who created the artwork for
the original Axis & Allies box cover,
create the cover for this version too.
ARTIST BIO - JIM BUTCHER
Besides having done the original
artwork for the game, Jim’s
experience with military work
is exceptional. After honing his
skills at the Maryland Institute
College of Art in 1962 where he
majored in graphic design and
painting, he began his art career
with the United States Marine
Corps in Vietnam, serving as an
offi cial USMC combat artist. He
focused on covering the air war
and the personnel who worked
with the aircraft, which at times
took him into combat situations.
After receiving an honorable
discharge in 1969, he continued
his career in art, opening his
own business and receiving
commissions from various
companies and government
entities. His work includes
commissions from British
Aerospace, Unicolor Corp., and
NASA, for projects such as the
commemoration of 75 years of
U.S. Marine Corp Aviation, a
mural for the Tuskeegee Airman
Museum in Detroit, Michigan,
and numerous space-related
events such as the Apollo Series,
the Viking Mission, and the
space shuttle operations.
Summary of Play
Axis & Allies can be played by up to
six players. The game depicts a twosided confl ict, so if you have more
than two players, split them up into the
Axis side and the Allies side.
The Allies powers include the United
States, United Kingdom, and Soviet
Union. The Axis powers include
Germany, Japan, and Italy. In a sixplayer game, each player controls
one world power. If fewer people
play, some will control more than
one power.
Each turn you take for a power, you
choose which units to build for that
power and whether or not to risk funds
into research (if playing with the
optional weapons development rules).
Then you move your attacking units
into hostile spaces and resolve those
attacks using dice rolls.
After combat, you may make
noncombat moves with your units
that did not take part in combat that
turn. Finally, you place the units you
purchased at the beginning of your
turn and then collect your income for
the turn, including income gained from
any newly conquered territories.
How to Win
When the Axis side or the Allies side
collectively holds 15 victory city
tokens at the end of a complete round
of play, that side wins the game.
Adjusting Game Length
If you want a shorter game,
play to 13 victory city
tokens. If you are up for
a longer game, play to a
complete victory of all 18
victory city tokens.
If you opt for one of these
alternatives, be sure all
players agree to it before
you start the game.

GAME COMPONENTS

Since an ally controls
Panama, this British
destroyer can move
through the canal.
The German cruiser cannot
pass through the Suez
Canal because Germany
does not control Egypt.
Movement Between Spaces
Units can move between adjacent spaces (those that share a common border).
The game board wraps around horizontally. Territories and sea zones on the
right edge of the board are adjacent to territories and sea zones on the left
edge. (Note that sea zone 20 connects to sea zone 55; sea zone 21 connects
to sea zone 44; and sea zone 25 connects to sea zone 43.) The top and
bottom edges of the board do not wrap around.
Islands
An island is a territory located entirely inside one sea
zone. A sea zone can contain at most one group of islands,
which is considered one territory. It is not possible to split
up land-based units so that they are on different islands in
the same group. Even if the land mass is not visible on the
game board, air units can land on islands and land-based
troops can disembark there.
Canals
There are two canals—artifi cial waterways that connect two larger
bodies of water—on the game board. The Panama Canal
connects the Pacifi c Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, while the
Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian
Ocean. A canal is not considered a space, so it doesn’t
block land movement: Land units can move freely between
Trans-Jordan and Egypt. Panama is one territory: No land
movement points are required to cross the canal within
Panama.
If you want to move sea units through a canal, your side (but
not necessarily your power) must control it at the start of
your turn (that is, you cannot use it the turn you capture it).
The side that controls Panama controls the Panama Canal.
The side that controls both Egypt and Trans-Jordan controls
the Suez Canal. If one side controls Egypt and the other controls Trans-Jordan,
the Suez is closed to sea units.
Victory Cities
On the map are 18 victory cities, all crucial to the war effort. The selection of
the 18 victory cities was based on historical importance of the city at the time.
“Importance” could be measured in terms of strategic location, industrial base,
resources, or other important strategic factors. Each city has a corresponding
victory city token, which are exchanged as those territories are won or lost.
Territories
The national control symbols on the spaces on the game board show which power
controls those spaces at the start of the game. In the 1942 game scenario, German
and Japanese players will place some of their national control markers on top of
some of the national control symbols presented on the map. This updates the 1941
map to the 1942 scenario.
All other spaces are neutral, such as Turkey or Mongolia, and are not aligned
with any power. Neutral territories are distinct in that they have neither IPC nor
national control symbols. They represent areas that are impassable for political
or geographic reasons. You cannot attack neutral territories, move into them, or
move over them with air units. Neutral territories do not have income values.
Most territories have an income value ranging from 1 to 12. This is the number
of industrial production certifi cates (IPCs) they produce each turn for their
controller. A few territories, such as Gibraltar, have no income value.
Each territory exists in one of three conditions:
Friendly: A territory with a control marker owned by you or a friendly power
 (one on your side).
Hostile: A territory with a control marker owned by an enemy power (one on
 the opposing side).
Neutral: A territory that has no IPC value or national control symbol and
 that is not controlled by any power. The neutral territories are:
 Northern South America, Peruvian Central, Argentina/Chile, Eire,
 Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Sahara, Angola, Mozambique, Turkey,
 Saudia Arabia, Afganistan, Himalaya, and Mongolia.
Game Board
The game board is a refl ection of the world in 1941. It is divided into spaces by border lines. Land spaces are “territories”
and sea spaces are “sea zones.”
GAME COMPONENTS (continued) GAME COMPONENTS (continued)
Sea Zones
Sea zones are either friendly or
hostile. Friendly sea zones contain
no enemy surface warships. Hostile
sea zones contain enemy surface
warships. Note that the presence of
enemy submarines and/or transports
does not count for the purposes of
determining whether or not a sea zone
is hostile.

National Control Markers
National control markers indicate status in the game. They mark
conquered territories and record other information on the game’s charts.
Battle Board
The battle board is a large card with columns that list attacking
and defending units and their combat strengths. When
combat occurs, the players involved place their units on
the battle board.
,QGXVWULDO3URGXFWLRQ&HUWLÀFDWHV
These certifi cates (called IPCs) are the money of the game and
represent capacity for military production.
Combat Forces
Each power is color-coded as follows:
Green United States of America Gray Germany
Tan United Kingdom Orange Japan
Maroon Soviet Union Brown Italy
Light Green China
Two other units, antiaircraft guns and industrial complexes, are
light gray and not color-coded to a particular power.
These can change hands during play.
National Production/Research &
Development Chart
This chart shows each power’s production level and technological
advances. The national production chart is used to track each power’s
national production level throughout the game. Whenever you develop
a new technology, place one of your power’s control markers inside the
appropriate advancement box on the research & development chart.
National Setup Charts
These charts (one of each power) list the number and type of units to
be placed in the corresponding power’s territories and sea zones. Each
power’s national objectives are shown on the back of the chart.
Plastic Chips
Use these chips to save space in overcrowded zones. Putting a gray chip
under a unit shows that there is one additional unit of that unit type on the
space. Putting a red chip under a unit shows that there are fi ve additional
units of that unit type on the space.
Example: A destroyer with one gray chip under it counts as two destroyers. An infantry with one gray and one red chip under it
counts as seven infantry.
The number of stacks is not limited by the number of plastic chips available.
SETUP
1941 Scenario
The Axis players begin with 6 victory city tokens, and the Allies begin with 12.
1942 Scenario
The Axis players begin with 8 victory city tokens, and the Allies begin with 10.
Board setup for 1942 scenario: The game board refl ects the 1941 scenario. If you would prefer to play the 1942 scenario,
you will need to place some national control markers to refl ect the historical situation for that year. The placement of these
markers is indicated on the German and Japanese national setup charts for 1942. Put the markers on top of the existing
national control symbols shown on the game board.

China was an important power in the war, but unlike the other major powers, it was not an industrialized nation at the time.
For this reason, it receives special treatment in the Anniversary Edition. Also, some of the normal rules apply to China in
slightly different ways.
China and its units are controlled by the U.S. player, but for game purposes it is considered a separate power and its
resources cannot be mixed. The U.S. player takes China’s turn at the same time as the U.S. turn but Chinese unit combat and
movement are done separately from the U.S. forces. The U.S. player must complete the Combat Move and Conduct Combat
phases for Chinese forces before beginning the Combat Move phase for U.S. forces, or vice versa.
Chinese territories on the game board have a Nationalist Chinese national control symbol on them. The IPC values printed on
the Chinese territories indicate the number of IPCs an Axis player will receive when taking control of the territory.
The Chinese army represented in the game does not receive IPCs for income or use IPCs to generate new units. Instead,
China gets one new infantry unit per turn for every two Chinese territories that are not under Axis control during the
Purchase Units phase of the U.S. player’s turn.
The U.S. player places the new Chinese units at the same time that the new U.S. units are placed. They may be placed on
any Chinese-controlled territories, however those units cannot be placed on any territory that already contains three or
more units.
Chinese units have a limited range of occupation, displayed by the colored border. They can also be moved into the Japanese
occupied territories of Kiangsu and Manchuria. China can take control of these territories and have them count toward their
new infantry placements. Chinese units cannot be loaded onto transports.
Kwangtung is a special case. While it is not a Chinese territory and cannot be controlled by China, Chinese forces can attack
Axis units there and occupy it, but the IPCs generated go to the United Kingdom. This is the only non-Chinese territory that
Chinese units may occupy.
At the beginning of the game, China has a U.S. fi ghter unit located on the map. This represents the American volunteer
group—the Flying Tigers. This fi ghter is considered part of the Chinese forces for purposes of movement and combat. If it is
destroyed, the U.S. player cannot purchase a new fi ghter unit for China.
CHINA RULES
China can control
Manchuria and
Kiangsu.
Chinese forces can
occupy Kwangtung,
but they cannot
control it.
Phase 1: Research & Development
Note: This is an optional rule—players should decide whether or not this phase
will be included in their game.
In this phase, you may attempt to develop improved military technology. To do
so, you buy researchers that give you a chance for a scientifi c breakthrough. Each
researcher token will grant you one die that provides a chance for a breakthrough.
Research & Development Sequence
1. Buy researcher tokens
2. Roll research dice
3. Roll breakthrough die
4. Mark developments
Step 1: Buy Researcher Tokens
Each researcher token costs 5 IPCs. Buy as many as you wish, including none.
Step 2: Roll Research Dice
For each researcher you have, roll one die.
Success: If you roll at least one “6,” you have successfully made a technological
breakthrough. Discard all your researcher tokens and continue to step 3.
Failure: If you do not roll a “6,” your research has failed. Keep all your
researcher tokens and continue to the Purchase Units phase of the turn.
Step 3. Roll Breakthrough Die
If you rolled a “6” on any research die, choose one of the two breakthrough
charts (next page) and roll a die to see which technological advance you get.
You can only receive one advance each turn. If you have already received the
same result on a previous turn, reroll until you get a new technological advance.
Once you have received all the advances on a chart, you cannot gain any more
advances from that chart.
Axis & Allies is played in rounds.
One round consists of each power
taking a turn.
The order that players take turns
depends on the scenario:
1941 Scenario
1. Germany
2. Soviet Union
3. Japan
4. United Kingdom
5. Italy
6. United States
1942 Scenario
1. Japan
2. Soviet Union
3. Germany
4. United Kingdom
5. Italy
6. United States
If you control more than one power,
keep those powers’ income and units
separate. You can conduct operations
for only one power at a time.
Turn Sequence
Each power’s turn consists of seven
phases, which take place in a fi xed
sequence. You must collect income if
you can, but all other parts of the turn
sequence are voluntary. After each
power fi nishes a turn, play then passes
to the next power.
1. Research & Development
 (Optional Rule)
2. Purchase Units
3. Combat Move
4. Conduct Combat
5. Noncombat Move
6. Mobilize New Units
7. Collect Income
At the end of the United States
player’s turn, check for victory. If
neither side has won, begin a new
round of play.
ORDER OF PLAY
1 2 1 3
Air units
can move
through a
hostile space
as if it was
friendly.
Land units
must end their
movement when
they encounter
enemy units,
including
antiaircraft guns
and industrial
complexes.
Step 4: Mark Developments
If your research was successful, place one of your national control markers inside the appropriate advancement box on the
research & development chart. Your development becomes effective immediately.
Any number of powers may develop the same technology, but powers cannot share their technology.
BREAKTHROUGH CHART 1
1. Advanced Artillery. Each of your artillery
units can now provide greater support. One artillery
unit can support two infantry per attack. Two
infantry when coupled with one artillery unit each
have an attack value of 2.
2. Rockets. Your antiaircraft guns are now rocket
launchers. In addition to its normal combat function,
during the strategic bombing raid step of your
Conduct Combat phase each turn, each of your
antiaircraft guns can make a single rocket attack
against an enemy industrial complex within 3 spaces
of it. This attack does 1d6 damage to that complex.
3. Paratroopers. Each of your bombers can act as
a transport for up to one infantry, but it must stop in
the fi rst hostile territory it enters during a turn and
drop off the infantry, ending its combat movement.
The bomber may still attack during the Conduct
Combat phase, but it cannot make a strategic
bombing run in a turn that it transports an infantry
unit. The infantry unit may retreat normally to a
friendly adjacent space during combat.
4. Increased Factory Production. Each of
your industrial complexes can now produce two
additional units beyond its listed IPC value. For
example, Germany with 10 IPCs can now produce
12 units. Also, when repairing a damaged industrial
complex (removing damage markers), you can
remove two damage markers at a time for the cost of
1 IPC (half price).
5. War Bonds. During your Collect Income phase,
roll 1d6 and collect that many additional IPCs.
6. Mechanized Infantry. Each infantry that is
matched up with a tank can move two spaces along
with the tank.
BREAKTHROUGH CHART 2
1. Super Submarines. The attack value of your
submarines is now 3 instead of 2. The defense value
of your submarines remains at 1.
2. Jet Fighters. The attack value of your fi ghters
is now 4 instead of 3.
3. Improved Shipyards. Your sea units are now
cheaper to build. Use these revised costs:
Unit IPC cost

Aircraft Carrier 11
Cruiser 10
Destroyer 7
Transport 6
Submarine 5
4. Radar. Your antiaircraft gun fi re now hits on a 1
or 2 instead of just a 1.
5. Long-Range Aircraft. Your fi ghters are now
long-range fi ghters, and your bombers are now
long-range bombers. Your fi ghters’ range increases
from 4 to 6. Your bombers’ range increases from
6 to 8.
6. Heavy Bombers. Your bombers are now heavy
bombers. You roll two dice for each bomber when
you attack or make a strategic bombing raid. On
defense, your bombers still roll only a single die.
Phase 2: Purchase Units
In this phase, you may spend IPCs for additional units to be used in future turns. All the units on your power’s national setup
chart are available for purchase. A unit’s price in IPCs is listed in the cost column next to the unit’s name.
Each industrial complex can only produce as many new units as the IPC value indicated on the territory in which it is located.
For example, Germany can produce 10 units per turn.
Industrial complexes are subject to strategic bombing raids and rockets. For each damage marker an industrial complex has
under it during the Mobilize New Units phase, it can produce one less unit.
Purchase Units Sequence
1. Order units
2. Pay for units & repairs
3. Place units in mobilization zone
Step 1: Order Units
Select all the units you wish to buy. You may buy as many units as you can afford, regardless of which units you started the
game with. If a unit type is not available (because those units are all in play), you can still purchase additional units of that type,
however all of the players must agree on the method of representation (markers, coins, slips of paper, etc.) for those units.
Step 2. Pay for Units & Repairs
Pay IPCs to the bank equal to the total cost of the purchased units.
You can also pay to remove damage markers from under industrial complexes that have
been damaged. Each damage marker costs 1 IPC to remove.
Step 3: Place Units in Mobilization Zone
Place the purchased units in the mobilization zone on the game board (located in the
South Atlantic Ocean). You cannot use these units right away, but you will deploy
them later in the turn. In contrast, purchased repairs (removal of damage markers) to
industrial complexes take effect immediately.
Phase 3: Combat Move
Move as many of your units into as many hostile territories and hostile sea zones as you
wish. Movement into a hostile territory counts as combat movement, whether that territory is occupied or not. You can move
into a single hostile space from different spaces, as long as each moving unit can reach that space with a legal move.
You may move units through friendly spaces en route to hostile spaces during this phase. However, units cannot end their
move in friendly spaces during the Combat Move phase except in four instances:

Sea units other than submarines must end their movement when they
encounter enemy units. The destroyer must stop in this zone, however, the
submarine can pass through safely since the enemy unit is not a destroyer.
Units cannot
move into
neutral
territories.
Amphibious assault movement occurs during the Combat Move phase. After your
transport loads units, your battleship must destroy the enemy destroyer in sea combat
LQRUGHUWRFOHDUWKHKRVWLOHVHD]RQHVRWKDWWKHWUDQVSRUWFDQRIÁRDGLQWR)UDQFH
If there had been only defending submarines and/or transports, the attacking U.S.
player could have ignored those units, or could have conducted sea combat.
Submarines can move through or into a hostile sea zone
containing enemy warships without attacking.
Moving transports and any accompanying units into a sea
zone from which you plan to make an amphibious assault
counts as a combat move, even if there are no defending
surface warships there.
During the Conduct Combat phase, you can only launch
amphibious assaults that you announced during this phase.
(See Conduct Combat: Amphibious Assaults, pg. 17.)
Special Combat Movement
A number of units can make special moves during this
phase. These are described in detail below. (For complete
information on each combat unit’s capabilities, see Unit
Profi les, pg. 24.)
Aircraft Carriers
Any fi ghters belonging to an aircraft carrier launch before
the carrier moves and move independently of the carrier.
These fi ghters can make a combat move from the carrier’s
sea zone, or they can remain in the sea zone until the Noncombat
Move phase.
Guest fi ghters belonging to a friendly power on board another
power’s carrier must remain on board as cargo if the carrier moves
in combat. They cannot take part in combat and are destroyed if the
carrier is destroyed.
Whether it moves during the Combat Move or Noncombat Move
phase, an aircraft carrier allows friendly fi ghters to land on it in the
sea zone where it fi nishes its move.
Submarines
Submarines are capable of moving undetected due to
their ability to submerge. For this reason, they have
special movement rules. A submarine may move
through or into a sea zone containing enemy warships
during either the Combat Move or Noncombat Move
phase. Unlike other sea units, a submarine may end its
noncombat movement in a hostile sea zone. However,
if a submarine enters a sea zone containing an enemy
destroyer, its movement ends immediately.
This ability of submarines to avoid detection
also allows enemy ships to ignore their
presence. Any sea zone that contains
only enemy submarines does not stop the
movement of a sea unit. Sea units ending
their combat movement in a sea zone
containing only enemy submarines may
choose to attack them or not. Sea units may
also end their noncombat movement in a sea
zone containing only enemy submarines.
controls it (the space remains in control of the power that controlled it at the start of
the turn).
Units cannot move into or through neutral territories.
Units from the same side can freely share
territories, sea zones, and space on aircraft
carriers and transports with one another.
These shared events must be agreed upon
by both powers.
All combat movement is considered to take
place at the same time: Thus, you cannot
move a unit, then conduct combat, then
move that unit again during this phase.
You cannot move additional units into an
embattled space once an attack has begun.
A land or sea unit may move a number of spaces up to its move value. Most units must stop when they enter a hostile space.
Thus, a unit with a move value of 2 could move into a friendly space and then a hostile space, or just into a hostile space.
An enemy submarine and/or transport does not block any of your unit’s movement, nor does it prevent loading or offl oading
in that sea zone. You are not required to attack an enemy submarine or transport that shares a sea zone with you if that sea
zone contains only enemy submarines and/or transports.
Sea Units Starting in Hostile Sea Zones
At the beginning of the Combat Move phase, you may already have sea units in spaces containing enemy units that were
there at the start of your turn. For example, an enemy may have built new sea units in a sea zone where you have ships. When
your turn comes around again, you are sharing a sea zone with enemy forces.
If you are sharing a sea zone with enemy surface warships (not submarines and/or transports), this situation requires you to
do one of the following:
s 2EMAININTHESEAZONEANDCONDUCTCOMBAT

s ,EAVETHESEAZONETOLOADUNITSANDRETURNTOTHESAMESEAZONETOCONDUCTCOMBATOR
s ,EAVETHESEAZONEANDCONDUCTNOCOMBAT
Once these sea units have moved and/or participated in combat, they cannot move or participate in the Noncombat Move
phase of the turn. You cannot load units while in the original contested sea zone.
Air Units
An air unit that moves in this phase must reserve part of its move value for the Noncombat Move phase, at which point it
must return to a safe landing spot using its remaining move.
An air unit’s movement in any complete turn is limited to its total move value. Thus, a bomber with a normal move value of
6 cannot move six spaces to get to a hostile space. It must save at least one movement point to get to a neighboring friendly
territory where it can land. A fi ghter can move its full four spaces to attack instead of saving movement, but only if a carrier
could be there by the conclusion of the Mobilize New Units phase. (See Unit Profi les: Air Units, pg. 26.)
Air units attacking territories with antiaircraft guns will be fi red upon. (See Unit Profi les: Antiaircraft Guns, pg. 25.)
Amphibious Assaults
If you want to make any amphibious
assaults during the Conduct Combat
phase, you announce your intent
to do so during this phase. An
amphibious assault takes place when
you attack a coastal territory from a
non-hostile sea zone by offl oading
land units from transports into that
target territory (or make a joint
attack with both seabor

You can blitz a tank through two territories if the

\RXUFRQWUROPDUNHULQWKHÀUVWWHUULWRU\
You must stop the tank’s movement when it
encounters any enemy units, including antiaircraft
guns and industrial complexes.
When the bombers make a raid against the
industrial complex, the antiaircraft gun in
that territory makes an attack against each
bomber doing so. A roll of 1 destroys the
bomber on the left. The surviving bomber
then makes an attack against the industrial
complex, getting a 3 on the roll for 3 damage.
After a successful sea
combat, the U.S.

and infantry against the
one German infantry.
At this point, the units
move to the battle board
to see who wins the
combat. The tank has an
attack value of 3, and the
attacking infantry has an
attack value of 1, while
the defending infantry’s
defense value is 2.
1. Strategic Bombing Raids
During this step, you may bomb the enemy’s industrial complexes with your
bombers. A strategic bombing raid is an economic attack. The attacking bombers
will cause a number of points of damage to the target complexes equal to the
total rolled on the dice used for the attack.
After resolving any antiaircraft fi re (see Unit Profi les: Antiaircraft Guns, pg.
25), surviving bombers each roll one die (or two dice for heavy bombers). The
total rolled on the dice is the number of damage markers that are placed under
the attacked industrial complex. An industrial complex cannot receive more total
damage than twice the IPC value of the territory on which it is located. Any
excess damage is not applied.
A bomber that performed a strategic bombing raid cannot participate in any other
combat this turn and must return to a friendly territory during the Noncombat
Move phase.
2. Amphibious Assaults
During this step you will resolve each
amphibious assault you announced during
the Combat Move phase. If you did not
announce an amphibious assault, go to
General Combat (see pg. 18).
Amphibious Assault Sequence
1. Sea combat
2. Battleship & cruiser bombardment
3. Land combat
Step 1. Sea Combat: If there are
defending warships, sea combat must
occur. If there are only defending
submarines and/or transports, the attacker
may choose to ignore those units or conduct sea combat.
If sea combat occurs, all attacking sea units must participate in the battle. Conduct the sea combat using the rules for
General Combat (see pg. 18), then go to step 3 (land combat).
If no sea combat occurs, go to step 2 (bombardment).
Step 2. Battleship & Cruiser Bombardment: If there was NOT a combat in the sea zone from which you are offl oading
units from transports, any accompanying battleships and cruisers may bombard the coastal territory being attacked. The
number of ships that can make bombardment attacks is limited to one ship per land unit being offl oaded from the transports
in that coastal territory. Destroying transports counts as a combat.
Roll one die for each battleship and cruiser. Battleships hit on a “4” or less, and cruisers hit on a “3” or less (their attack
numbers). For each hit, the defender moves a defending unit to the casualty zone of the battle board (used for land combat,
below). These casualties will be able to defend during the land combat step before they are eliminated.
Each battleship or cruiser can only bombard one coastal territory per turn.
Step 3. Land Combat: If the sea zone has been cleared of all defending enemy warships except submarines and transports,
and the attacker still has land units committed to the coastal territory, move all attacking and defending units to the battle
board and conduct combat using the general combat rules (on the next page). Remember to put casualties from bombardment
(if any) in the casualty zone.
Attacking land units can come from the ocean (seaborne), and they can come from neighboring territories that are adjacent to
the attacked territory. Any land units offl oading from a single transport can only be offl oaded into a single hostile territory.
If no land units (carried as cargo) survived the sea combat, or if the attacking sea units withdrew from the sea combat, then
any other units that were designated to participate in the land attack (including air units) must still conduct one round of land
combat in a regular attack on the intended hostile territory before they can retreat.
Tanks and Blitzing
A tank can “blitz” by moving through an unoccupied hostile territory as the fi rst part of a move that can end in a friendly
or hostile territory. The complete move must occur during the Combat Move phase. The tank establishes control of the fi rst
territory (place one of your control markers there) before it moves to the next.
Remember to adjust the national production levels as you blitz. A tank that encounters enemy units in the fi rst territory it
enters must stop there, even if the unit is an antiaircraft gun or an industrial complex.
Transports
If a transport encounters hostile surface warships (not enemy submarines and/or transports) AFTER it begins to move (not
counting the sea zone it started in), its movement for that turn ends, and it must stop there and conduct sea combat.
A transport may load units while in any friendly sea zone along its route, including the sea zone it started in. If a transport
loads land units during the Combat Move phase, it must offl oad those units to attack a hostile territory as part of an
amphibious assault during the Conduct Combat phase or it must retreat during sea combat. A transport that is part of an
amphibious assault must end its movement in a friendly sea zone (or one that will become friendly as a result of sea combat)
from which it can conduct the assault.
Any land units aboard a transport are considered cargo until they offl oad. Cargo cannot take part in sea combat and is
destroyed if the transport is destroyed.
Any units can pass through a sea zone containing only transports during the Combat Move phase. However, if a warship
chooses to sink an unescorted transport, that warship must end its move in that sea zone.
Phase 4: Conduct Combat
In this phase, you conduct combat against opposing units using the following sequence:
Combat Sequence
1. Strategic bombing raids
2. Amphibious assaults
3. General combat
A number of units have special rules that modify or overwrite the combat rules in this section. See Unit Profi les, pg. 24, for
combat rules associated with each type of unit.
At no time may an Allies power attack another Allies power, or an Axis power attack another Axis power.

The attacking units come from two territories. All units are moved to the battle board.
$IWHUWKHDWWDFNLQJDQGGHIHQGLQJXQLWVÀUHDQGUHPRYHFDVXDOWLHV
the attacker may choose to retreat.
After one round of attacks, the attacking player decides to retreat,
but the destroyer must retreat to one of the sea zones the
attacking forces came from.
Defenseless Transports: In a sea
battle, if the defender has only transports
remaining and the attacker still has units
capable of attacking, the defending
transports are all destroyed, along with
their cargo. You do not have to continue
rolling dice until all the transports receive
hits—this will speed up combats.
This also occurs if the defender has only
transports and submerged submarines
remaining, and the attacker has only
air units remaining. The air units and
submarines cannot hit each other, so the
transports are defenseless. At this point,
defenseless transports are all destroyed,
along with their cargo. Attacking
transports are never considered
defenseless, since they have the option
RIUHWUHDWLQJ5HPHPEHUKRZHYHUWKDW
destroying defenseless transports in
this way still counts as combat for the
purpose of offshore bombardment and
similar rules.
If the attacker does not have any attacking land units left, or if the attacking fl eet is eliminated, the amphibious assault is over.
Keep the attacking overland land units and seaborne land units separated on the battle board. Attacking seaborne units cannot
retreat. Attacking overland land units and aircraft can retreat (between rounds of combat). All attacking overland land units
must retreat together as a group. They can only retreat to where at least one of them originated. They must all retreat at the
same time and to the same place. A retreat may happen at the conclusion of any round of combat.
Attacking air units, whether involved in the sea combat or the attack on the coastal territory, may retreat according to the normal
rules (they land during the Noncombat Move phase). If they do so, the attacking air units must all disengage at the same time.
Air units and overland units (if any) must retreat at the same time.
Air Units: Each attacking air unit may participate in the sea battle or the attack on the coastal territory; it cannot do both.
The attacking player must declare which air units are involved in each part of the attack and cannot change their assignments
later. At the end of the amphibious assault, all aircraft remain in place; they will land during the Noncombat Move phase.
Air units defending in a territory can only fi ght in that territory. They cannot participate in the sea combat.
3. General Combat
In this step, you resolve combat in each space that contains your units and enemy units.
Combat is resolved by fi ring (rolling dice) according to a standard sequence. Combat in each space takes place at the same time,
but each affected territory or sea zone is resolved separately and completely before resolving combat in the next contested space.
The attacker decides the order of spaces in which each combat occurs. No new units may enter as reinforcements once combat
has begun.
Attacking and defending units in each space are considered to fi re at the same time, but for ease of play you roll dice in
sequence: attacker fi rst, then defender.
General Combat Sequence
1. Place units on battle board 4. Remove defender’s casualties
2. Attacking units fi re 5. Press attack or retreat
3. Defending units fi re 6. Conclude combat
Step 1. Place Units on
Battle Board
The battle board has two
sides, labeled “Attacker”
and “Defender.” Place
all your attacking units
and all defending units
from the battle onto
their respective sides, in
the numbered columns
that contain those units’
names and silhouettes.
The number in a unit’s
column identifi es that
unit’s attack or defense
value. An attacking
infantry’s attack value
is 1, for example, and a
defending infantry is 2.
In a sea battle, place any cargo (whether your own units or an ally’s) beside the transport ship that is carrying it. Cargo does
not roll, nor can it take a hit. It is lost with the transport carrying it if that unit is destroyed.
If you are attacking into a sea zone that contains friendly units, your ally’s units are not brought onto the battle board,
but remain out of play for this turn.
Step 2. Attacking Units Fire
Submarines have the Surprise Strike ability. Both attacking and defending submarines fi re before other combat units during a
sea battle. (See “Surprise Strike” in Unit Profi les: Submarines, pg. 30.)
Roll one die for each attacking unit with an attack value. Roll for units with the same
attack value at the same time. For example, roll all units with an attack value of “3” at
the same time.
An attacking unit scores a hit if you roll its attack value or less.
After the attacking player has rolled for all attacking units, the defender chooses one unit
for each hit scored and moves it to the casualty zone. (It will return fi re in the next step
of combat.)
Step 3. Defending Units Fire
Defending submarines will have already fi red using their Surprise Strike ability
mentioned in Step 2. All the units on the defender’s side roll one die for each unit with a
defense value (including units in the casualty zone). Roll for units with the same defense
value at the same time.
A defending unit scores a hit if you roll its defense value or less.
After the defender has rolled for each defending unit, the attacker chooses one unit for
each hit scored and removes it from play, returning it to the storage tray.
Step 4. Remove Defender’s Casualties
Remove the defender’s units in the casualty zone from play, returning them to the
storage tray.
Step 5. Press Attack or Retreat
Combat rounds (steps 1–4) continue unless one of the following two conditions occurs
(in this order):
Condition A—Attacker and/or Defender
Loses All Units
Once all units with combat values on one or both
sides have been destroyed, the combat ends.
If a player has combat units remaining on the
battle board, that player wins the combat. Players
that have units remaining on the battle board
return those units to the contested space on the
game board.
In a sea battle, if both sides have only transports
remaining, the attacker’s transports may remain
in the contested sea zone or retreat per the rules
in Condition B below.
Condition B—Attacker Retreats
The attacker (never the defender) can retreat during
this step. Move all attacking land and sea units in that
combat on the battle board to a single adjacent friendly
space from which at least one of the attacking units
moved. In the case of sea units, that space must have
been friendly at the start of the turn. All such units
must retreat together to the same territory, regardless
of where they came from.
Retreating air units remain in the contested space temporarily. They complete their retreat movement during the Noncombat
Move phase using the same rules as an air unit involved in a successful battle.
2 0 2 1
Step 6. Conclude Combat
If you win a combat as the attacker in a territory and you
have one or more surviving land units there, you take
control of it. Otherwise, it remains in the defender’s control.
(If all units on both sides were destroyed, the territory
remains in the defender’s control.) Sea units cannot take
control of a territory; they must stay at sea.
Air units cannot capture a territory. If your attack force
has only air units remaining, you cannot occupy the
territory you attacked, even if there are no enemy units
remaining. Air units must return to a friendly territory
(fi ghters may also land on a friendly carrier). They do so
during the Noncombat Move phase. Until then, they stay
at the space where they fought.
Remove surviving land units from the battle board and place them in the newly conquered territory. Place your control
marker on the territory. (Note, if you are playing in the 1942 scenario, place you marker on top of the original control
marker; do not remove it). Adjust the control markers on the national production chart. Your national production increases
by the value of the captured territory; the loser’s production decreases by the same amount.
An antiaircraft gun or industrial complex in the captured territory remains there but now belongs to your side (see Liberating
a Territory, below). If you capture an antiaircraft gun, you cannot move it in the Noncombat Move phase of the same turn. If
you capture an industrial complex, you cannot mobilize new units there until your next turn.
Liberating a Territory
If you capture a territory that was originally controlled by another member of your side, you “liberate” the territory. You
do not take control of it; instead, the original controller regains the territory and its income. Antiaircraft guns or industrial
complexes in that territory revert to the original controller of the territory.
If the original controller’s capital is in enemy hands at the end of the turn in which you would otherwise have liberated the
territory, you capture the territory, collect income from the newly captured territory, and use any industrial complex there
until the original controller’s capital is liberated. You also take ownership of any antiaircraft gun in that territory.
Capturing and Liberating Capitals
If you capture a territory containing an enemy capital (Washington, Moscow, London, Berlin, Rome, or Tokyo), follow the
same rules as for capturing a territory. Add the captured territory’s income value to your national production.
In addition, you collect all unspent IPCs from the original owner of the captured capital (but not subsequent power’s
controlling that capital). For example, if Germany conquers Moscow while the Soviet Union’s player is holding 18 IPCs,
those IPCs are immediately transferred to Germany’s player. But if the United Kingdom’s player then takes Moscow, that
player would not collect IPCs from Germany’s player.
The original owner of the captured capital is still in the game but cannot collect income from any territories he or she still
controls and cannot buy new units and/or research technologies until the capital is liberated. That player skips all but the
Combat Move, Conduct Combat, and Noncombat Move phases. If that power or one on its side liberates the capital, the
original owner can once again collect income from territories he or she controls, including territories reverting control to him
or her.
If a capital is liberated, the industrial complex and any antiaircraft guns in that capital territory revert ownership to the
original owner of the capital. Territories and industrial complexes that are controlled by the newly liberated capital’s owner
but are in the hands of friendly powers also revert ownership. Antiaircraft guns outside the newly liberated capital territory
remain under their pre-liberation ownership.
Capturing a Victory City
When you capture a territory containing an enemy victory city, take possession of its corresponding victory city token.
If at the end of the round after the U.S. player’s turn your side controls enough victory cities to achieve the victory condition
you decided upon at the start of the game, your side wins.
Multinational Forces
Units on the same side can share a territory or sea zone, constituting a multinational force. Such forces can defend together,
but they cannot attack together. (This does not mean powers can share income; only the power that controls a territory
collects income for that territory.)
A multinational force cannot attack the same space together. Any units in a sea zone in which a battle occurs that belong to
an ally of the attacker cannot participate in the battle in any way. Such units cannot be taken as losses in the sea combat and
have no effect on defending submarines. Each attacking power moves and fi res its own units on its own turn.
An attacking fi ghter may launch from an aircraft carrier owned by an ally, but the ally’s carrier cannot move until its
controller’s turn. Similarly, an attacking carrier can carry an ally’s fi ghter as cargo, but the ally’s fi ghter cannot participate in
an attack by that carrier.
An attacking land unit can assault a coastal territory from an ally’s transport, but only on the attacking land unit owner’s turn.
Multinational Defense: When a space containing a multinational force is attacked, all its units defend together. The attacker
fi res fi rst as usual. If a hit is scored, the defenders mutually determine the casualty. If they cannot agree, the attacker chooses.
Each defender rolls separately for his or her units.
Transporting Multinational Forces: Transports belonging to a friendly power can load and offl oad your land units. This is
a three-step process:
1. You load your land units aboard the friendly transport on your turn.
2. The transport’s controller moves it (or not) on that player’s turn.
3. You offl oad your land units on your next turn.
Phase 5: Noncombat Move
In this phase, you can move any of your units that did not move in the Combat Move phase or participate in combat during
your turn. This is a good time to gather your units, either to strengthen vulnerable territories or to reinforce units at the front.
You will also land all your aircraft that participated in and survived the Conduct Combat phase.
Only aircraft and submarines may move through hostile spaces during this phase.
Where Units Can Move
Land Units: Land units can move into any friendly territories. They cannot move into hostile territories (not even those that
contain no combat units but are enemy-controlled). Note, this is the only phase in which antiaircraft guns can move.
Air Units: An air unit must end its move in an eligible landing space. Bombers and fi ghters may land in any territory that
was friendly at the start of your turn.
Only fi ghters may land in a sea zone with a friendly carrier present. A landing spot must be available on the carrier.

 would end its noncombat movement in a sea zone. You cannot deliberately move any air unit out of range
 of a potential safe landing space.
Aircraft that cannot move to an eligible landing space by the end of the Noncombat Move phase are destroyed.
Neither bombers nor fi ghters may land in any territory that was hostile at the start of your turn, including any territory that
was just captured by you this turn.
Sea Units: Sea units can move through any friendly sea zone. They cannot move into or through hostile sea zones.
Transports can move to friendly coastal territories and load or offl oad cargo, unless they loaded, moved, or offl oaded during
the Combat Move or Conduct Combat phase.
Aircraft carriers can move to sea zones to allow friendly fi ghters to land. They must move there if they did not move in the
Combat Move phase and the friendly sea zone is the only valid landing zone for the fi ghters. An aircraft ca

Phase 6: Mobilize New Units
Move the newly purchased units from the mobilization zone on the game board to eligible spaces you have controlled
since the start of your turn, with the following exceptions (below). You cannot yet use industrial complexes that you
captured this turn.
Restrictions on Placement
For each industrial complex, you can mobilize only as many units as the IPC income value of the territory containing
the industrial complex. This limit includes units mobilized in sea zones adjacent to the industrial complex. For example,
Germany can mobilize 10 units.
Each damage marker under an industrial complex means one less new unit can enter the game at that factory.
You cannot place your new units at an industrial complex owned by a friendly power, unless that power’s capital is in
enemy control and you have taken control of the industrial complex from an enemy power after the friendly power’s
capital was captured.
Place land units and bombers only in territories containing eligible industrial complexes. Land units cannot enter play
on transports.
Place sea units only in sea zones adjacent to territories containing eligible industrial complexes. New sea units can enter
play even in a hostile sea zone. No combat occurs because the Conduct Combat phase is over.
Place fi ghters into territories containing an industrial complex controlled by your power from the start of your turn, or
on an aircraft carrier owned by your power in a sea zone adjacent to a territory with such an industrial complex. The
aircraft carrier may be either a new one or an existing one already in place. You cannot place a new fi ghter on a carrier
owned by a friendly power.
Place new industrial complexes in any territory that you have controlled since the start of your turn and that has an income
value of at least 1. You cannot have more than one industrial complex per territory.
If you do not place some of your units the turn you purchase them, they are not lost. You can place them on one of your
future turns during your Mobilize New Units phase.
Phase 7: Collect Income
In this phase, you earn production income to fi nance future attacks and strategies. Look up your power’s national
production level (indicated by your control marker) on the national production chart and collect that number of IPCs from
the bank.
If your capital is under an enemy power’s control, you cannot collect income nor can you collect bonus income. A power
cannot lend or give IPCs to another power, even if both powers are on the same side.
In addition, you may have reached your national objectives. A power reaching its national objectives is experiencing an
uplifting positive effect across the board—higher morale coupled with renewed vigor. This awards your economy an extra
boost of 5 or more IPCs per turn and is called “bonus income.”
National Objectives & Bonus Income
Note: This is an optional rule—players should decide whether or not this rule will be included in their game.
While the goal of the game is to capture victory cities, each power also has an objective related to its historic objectives.
These objectives, if achieved, will grant you bonus income.
The Allies, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, seemed able to meld their individual objectives into one
common cause—the complete and unconditional surrender of the Axis. This was also the offi cial posn of the Soviet
Union, but unlike the United States and the United Kingdom, the Soviets had world communism in mind as well.
Germany had its “Lebensraum”, Japan’s was “The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,” and Italy’s stated objective
was turning the Mediterranean Sea and the territories that border it into “Mare Nostrum.”
In recognition of these known national objectives, each country that reaches its individual national objectives will receive a
bonus sum of IPCs each turn.
Here are the national objectives for each power and their income bonus (also shown on the back of each national setup chart):
Axis Powers
The United States: “The Arsenal of
Democracy”
The United States was not always
the industrial giant that it suddenly
became. The conversion from a
peacetime industry to a wartime
one was done practically overnight.
Nonetheless, the reality of this
historical phenomenon proved to
be one of the undeniable strategic
realities of World War II.

UNIT PROFILES
This section provides detailed information for each unit in the game. Each entry has a short description, then lists the unit’s
cost in IPCs and its attack, defense, and move values. Each unit type also has special abilities, which are summarized below
its statistics. The following profi les do not take into account any special abilities attributed to the different units as a result of
weapons development.
Land Units
Iantry, artillery, tanks, and antiaircraft guns can attack and/or defend only in territories. Only infantry, artillery, and tanks
can capture hostile territories. All but industrial complexes can be carried by transports. Industrial complexes are located in
territories but cannot move, attack, defend, or be transported.
Infantry
Description: Basic land units that are strong on defense.
Cost: 3
Attack: 1 (2 when supported by artillery)
Defense: 2
Move: 1
Special Abilities
Supported by Artillery: When an infantry unit attacks along with an artillery unit, the infantry’s attack value increases from
1 to 2. Each infantry must be matched one-for-one with a supporting artillery unit. If your infantry outnumber your artillery,
the excess infantry units still have an attack value of 1. For example, if you attack with two artillery and fi ve infantry, two of
your infantry have an attack value of 2, and the rest, 1. Infantry are not supported by artillery on defense.
Artillery
Description: Provides extra punch and suprts infantry attacks.
Cost: 4
Attack: 2
Defense: 2
Move: 1
Special Abilities
Support Infantry: When an infantry unit attacks along with an artillery unit, the infantry’s attack value increases from 1 to 2.
Each infantry must be matched one-for-one with a supporting artillery unit. Artillery does not support infantry on defense.
Tanks
Description: Heavy-hitting and fast-moving units.
Cost: 5
Attack: 3
Defense: 3
Move: 2
Special Abilities
Blitz: Tanks can “blitz” by moving through an unoccupied hostile ory as the fi rst part of a two-space move that can
end in a friendly or hostile territory. This complete move must occur during the Combat Move phase. By blitzing, the tank
establishes control of the fi rst territory before it moves to the next. The second territory can be friendly or hostile, or even the
territory the tank came from. A tank that encounters enemy units in the fi rst territory it enters must stop there, even if the unit
is an antiaircraft gun or industrial complex.
Antiaircraft Guns
Description: These units represent extensive antiaircraft defenses.
Cost: 6
Attack: —
Defense: 1
Move: 1 (noncombat only)
Special Abilities
Limited Move: An antiaircraft gun cannot move during the Combat Move phase (other than being carried on a transport if the
antiaircraft gun was loaded on a prior turn).
Shoot Down Air Units: An antiaircraft gun may only fi re at an air unit when that unit attacks the territory containing that
antiaircraft gun. Antiaircraft guns fi re only during the fi rst round of combat anare then returned to the game board. Roll
one die for each air unit doing so (if there is more than one antiaircraft gun in a territory, only one can fi re, even if the
others are controlled by different powers). On a roll of 1, that air unit is destroyed and immediately removed from the
game. If all the aircraft are the same, fi ghters or bombers, there is no need to differentiate them. However, if there is a mix
of fi ghters and bombers, you must assign specifi c dice rolls to specifi c aircraft by indicating which aircraft is being rolled
for and rolling the die. A roll of 1 destroys the specifi ed aircraft. This special attack is made immediately before normal
combat occurs in the territory containing the antiaircraft gun.
Subject to Capture: If a territory is captured, any antiaircraft guns there are also captured. Their new owner is the player
controlling the territory at the end of that turn. They can be used by their new owner in future combat. Antiaircraft guns are
never destroyed, except when a transport carrying one is sunk. If you move an antiaircraft gun into a territory controlled by a
friendly power, place one of your control markers under it.
At the end of the United States player’s turn, check to see if either side has won the game based on the victory city condition
you are playing to.
 Default “Surrender with Honor” 15
 Option 1 “Projection” 13
 Option 2 “Total War” 18
If your side controls enough victory cities to achieve the preset victory condition, you all win the war.
Othernew turn and continue the confl ict.

Industrial Complexes
Description: These factories are a point of entry for newly produced units.
Cost: 15
Attack: N/A
Defense: N/A
Move: Cannot move.
Special Abilities
Cannot Attack, Defend, or Move: An industrial complex cannot attack, defend, or move. It cannot be transported. It is not
placed on the battle board.
Mobilization Sites: You may mobilize units only in territories containing industrial complexes you have controlled since the
start of your turn. You can mobilize only a number of units up to the income value of the territory containing the industrial
complex (for example, an industrial complex built in Eastern Canada may mobilize up to three units per turn). You can place
new industrial complexes in any territory that you have controlled since the start of your turn and that has an income value of
at least 1. There cannot be more than one industrial complex per territory.
Damaged Factories (Industrial Complexes): Bombers and rockets can damage industrial complexes directly. Damage markers
are placed under the targeted industrial complex. For each damage marker that is under a given industrial complex, one less
unit can be mobilized by that factory. Total damage to an industrial complex cannot exceed twice the IPC value of the territory
on which the factory is located. Industrial complexes are never destroyed. They can be heavily damaged, however, and can be
damaged to the point where they have at least as many damage markers as they have production ability. In this case, no new
units can enter the game through that factory until it is repaired.
Damage markers can be removed at a cost of 1 IPC each. These repairs are paid for (and the damage markers are removed)
during the Purchase Units phase of the turn.
Usable by Invading Forces: If a territory is captured, an industrial complex there is also captured. The capturing player can
use it on the turn after it is captured, but any existing damage markers remain under the industrial complex.
You cannot place your new units at an industrial complex owned by a friendly power, unless that power’s capital is in enemy
hands. Even if you liberate a territory with an industrial complex in it, you cannot use the complex; the original controller
can use it on his or her next turn.
Air Units
Fighters and bombers can attack and defend in territories. Both can attack in sea zones. Fighters stationed on carriers can
defend in sea zones. Both can land only in friendly territories and fi ghters can land on fridly aircraft carriers. Your air
units cannot land in territories you just captured, whether they were involved in the combat or not. Air units can move
through hostile territories and sea zones as if they were friendly. However, they are exposed to antiaircraft fi re during combat
whenever they attack a hostile territory that contains an antiaircraft gun.
To determine range, count each space your air unit enters “after takeoff.” When moving over water from a coastal territory
or an island group, count ti rst sea zone entered as one space. When fl ying to an island group, count the surrounding sea
zone and the island group itself as one space each. (An island is considered a territory within a sea zone; air units based on
an island cannot defend the surrounding sea zone.) When moving a fi ghter from a carrier, do not count the carrier’s sea zone
as the fi rst space—your fi ghter is in that sea zone. To participate in combat, a fi ghter must take off from its carrier before the
carrier moves, otherwise s cargo.
You cannot send air units on “suicide runs,” deliberately moving them into combat with no place to land afterward. If there
is any question about whether an attack is a “suicide run,” then in the Combat Move phase, you must declare, prior to rolling
any battles, some possible way (however remote the possibility is) for all your attacking air units to land safely that turn.
This could include a combination of combat moves. It could also include noncombat moves by a carrier. If it does includbat moves by a carrier, then the carrier cannot move in the Combat Move phase.
In order to demonstrate that an air unit MAY have a safe landing zone, you may assume that all of your attacking rolls will
be hits, and all defending rolls will be misses. You cannot, however, use a planned retreat of any carrier to demonstrate a
possible safe landing zone for any fi ghter.
If you declared that a carrier will move during the Noncombat Move phase to provide a safe landing zone for a fi ghter moved
in the Combat Move phase, you must follow through and move the carrier to its planned location in the Noncombat Move
phase unless the fi ghter has landed safely elsewhere or has been destroyed before then.
Fighters
Description: These basic air units have strong defense and considerable range.
Cost: 10
Attack: 3
Defense: 4
Move: 4
Special Abilities
Land on Aircraft Carriers: Fighters can be carried by aircraft carriers. Up to two fi ghters can be on a friendly aircraft carrier
at a time. A fi ghter must be launched from the carrier’s initial position to participate in combat this turn. However, it may
land on a carrier in the Noncombat Move phase (even if retreating) or during any other noncombat move. (A fi ghter cannot
land on a carrier during the carrier’s movement.) Your aircraft carrier can move to a sea zone where one of your fi ghters has
ended its move (and in fact, it must do so if it is able) but cannot move any farther that turn.
A fi ghter based on a defending carrier that is destroyed in combat must try to l It must land on a different friendly carrier
in the same sea zone, move one space to a friendly territory or aircraft carrier, or be destroyed. This movement occurs after
all of the attacker’s combats have been resolved and before the attacker’s Noncombat Move phase begins.
Each of your fi ghters based on your attacking carrier launches before combat (even if it is not participating in combat) and
can retreat to a friendly territory or carrier within range if it survives combat. If any fi ghter is not n eligible landing space
by the end of the Noncombat Move phase, it is destroyed. (Note that an eligible landing space may include a sea zone in
which a new carrier will be placed in the Mobilize New Units phase, as long as there is a landing space available on it.)
Bombers
Description: These aircraft are major offensive weapons with long-range capabilities.
Cost: 12
Attack: 4
Defense: 1
Move: 6
Special Abilities
Strategic Bombing Raids: A bomber can make an economic attack against an enemy industrial complex. During the strategic
bombing raid step of the Conduct Combat phase, bombers that survive any antiaircraft fi re may attack the industrial complex.
Roll one die for each surviving bomber. The bombers will cause a number of points of damage to the industrial complex
equal to the total rolled on the dice. The maximum total damage strategic bombing raids can infl ict on one industrial complex
is twice the territory’s IPC value.

Sea Units
Battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, transpts, and submarines move, attack, and defend in sea zones. They
cannot move into territories. For the sake of these rules, the following are surface warships: battleships, carriers, cruisers, and
destroyers. Transports are not part of the group called warships. Submarines are warships, but they are not surface warships.
All sea units can move up to two friendly sea zones. They cannot move into or through hostile sea zones. If enemy units other
than submarines and transports occupy a sea zone, the sea zone is hostile and your sea units end their movement and enter
combat. Submarines are an exception: They can pass through a hostile sea zone without stopping, unless there is an enemy
destroyer present (see Destroyers, pg. 29).
Some sea units can carry other units. Transports can carry only land units. Aircraft carriers can carry up to two fi ghters.
Battleships
Description: These units are the strongest and most durable warships.
Cost: 20
Attack: 4
Defense: 4
Move: 2
Special Abilities
Two Hits to Destroy: A battleship requires two hits to destroy. If a battleship is hit, even by a submarine’s Surprise Strike,
turn it on its side to mark its damaged status but do not move it to the casualty zone of the battle board unless it takes a
second hit in the same combat. If a battleship survives a combat having taken one hit, return it upright to the game board.
Offshore Bombardment: Your battleships and cruisers can conduct offshore bombardment during an amphibious assault.
These battleships and cruisers must be in the me sea zone as the offl oading transport before they can conduct this
bombardment. Each battleship and cruiser fi res against enemy land units in the territory being attacked prior to land combat.
Battleships and cruisers cannot conduct offshore bombardment if they were involved in a sea combat prior to the amphibious
assault and cannot conduct more than one bombardment per turn. The number of battleships and cruisers that can bombard
during an amphibious assault is limited to one ship per land unit being offl oaded from the transports in that coastal territory.
Aircraft Carriers
Description: These are huge warships capable of carrying fi ghter aircraft.
Cost: 14
Attack: 1
Defense: 2
Move: 2
Special Abilities
Carry Fighters: An aircraft carrier can carry up to two fi ghters, including those belonging to friendly powers. Fighters from
friendly powers can take off from and land on your carriers, but only during that power’s turn. Any fi ghters belonging to the
aircraft carrier owner move independently of the rrier. These fi ghters can make a combat move from the carrier’s original
sea zone, or they can remain in the original sea zone until the Noncombat Move phase. Fighters belonging to friendly powers
on attacking carriers are always treated as cargo, since it is not their turn. Your aircraft carrier can move to or remain in a sea
zone where one of your fi ghters will end its noncombat move (and must do so if it is able).
Fighter Defense: Whenever a carrier is attacked, its fi ghters (even those belonging toriendly powers) are considered to be
defending in the air and can be chosen as casualties rather than the carrier. (However, a fi ghter cannot be chosen as a casualty
from a submarine hit, because submarines can attack only sea units.)
Cruisers
Description: These units are powerful yet inexpensive warships.
Costs: 12
Attack: 3
Defense: 3
Move: 2
Special Abilities
Offshore Bombardment: Your battleships and cruisers can conduct offshore bombardment during an amphibious assault.
These battleships and cruisers must be in the same sea zone as the offl oading transport before they can conduct this
bombardment. Each battleship and cruiser fi res against enemy land units in the territory being attacked prior to land combat.
Battleships and cruisers cannot conduct offshore bombardment if they were involved in a sea combat prior to the amphibious
assault and cannot conduct more than one bombardment per turn. The number of battleships and cruisers that can bombard
during an amphibious assault is limited to one ship per land unit being offl oaded from the transports in that coastal territory.
Destroyers
Description: These units are effective warships with strong anti-submarine capabilities.
Costs: 8
Attack: 2
Defense: 2
Move: 2
Special Abilities
Anti-sub Vessel: If a destroyer is in the same space as one or more enemy submarines, it cancels the Submersible, Surprise
Strike, and Sub Movement special powers of those submarines (but not any powers gained through research & development).
Additionally, your aircraft may attack enemy submarines.
3 0 3 1
Submarines
Description: These units are submersible warships with unique capabilities.
Cost: 6
Attack: 2
Defense: 1
Move: 2
Special Abilities
Submersible: Anytime a submarine would otherwise roll the die to attack or defend, it can submerge instead. This
removes it from the combat—it can no longer attack or take hits in that combat. Whenever a round of combat starts and a
submarine is in combat with only aircraft, it can submerge (before aircraft fi re).
Surprise Strike: Submarin make their attack roll before any other units, and players must remove casualties hit by
submarines before those units get a chance to make an attack or defense roll. This special attack only happens once at the
start of the attacking units fi re step. Then, the combat sequence continues normally. If both players have submarines, all the
submarines get to fi re a surprise strike before taking casualties. Any hits made during this attack that do not destroy units
(such as battleships) remain in effect until the end of the combat.
How submarines conduct combat: If there is at least one defending destroyer on the battle board, attacking
submarines cannot make a Surprise Strike. They will participate in combat during the attacking units fi re step
of the General Combat sequence. Otherwise, each attacking submarine may submerge or fi re. Remove each
submerging submarine from the battle board and place it on the game board in the contested sea zone. Roll
one die for each remaining attacking submarine.
After the attacking player has rolled for all attacking submarines, the defender chooses one sea unit
(submarines cannot hit air units) for each hit scored and moves it to the casualty zone.
If there is at least one attacking destroyer on the battle board, defending submarines will participate in combat
during the defending units fi re step of the General Combat sequence. Otherwise, each defending submarine
may submerge or fi re. Remove each submerging submarine from the battle board and place it on the game
board in the contested sea zone. Roll one die for each remaining defending submarine.
After the defending player has rolled for all defending submarines, the attacker chooses one sea unit
(submarines cannot hit air units) for each hit scored and removes it from play.
Finally, remove the defender’s units in the casualty zone from play.
Sub Movement: Units moving into a sea zone containing an enemy submarine ignore that submarine for purposes of
movement. Also, submarines treat hostile sea zones as if they were frieny for purposes of movement. However, if
a submarine enters a sea zone containing an enemy destroyer, its movement ends immediately. This “stealth” ability
of submarines also allows enemy ships to ignore their presence. Any sea zone that contains only enemy submarines
does not stop the movement of a sea unit. Sea units ending their combat movement in a sea zone containing only
enemy submarines may choose to attack them or not. Sea units may also end their noncombat movement in a sea zone
containing only y submarines.
Cannot Attack Air Units: When attacking or defending, submarines cannot hit air units.
Transports
Description: Can transport land units across water.
Cost: 7
Attack: 0
Defense: 0
Move: 2
Special Abilities
No Combat Value: Even though a transport can attack or defend, either alone or with other units, it has a combat value of
0. This means that a transport cannot fi re in the attacking unit’s or the defending unit’s fi re steps.
This lack of combat capability also allows enemy ships to ignohe presence of transports. Any sea zone that contains
only enemy transports does not stop the movement of a sea unit. Air or sea units (other than transports) ending their
combat movement in a sea zone containing only enemy transports automatically destroy those transports. This counts as
a sea combat for those sea units. Sea units may also end their noncombat movement in a sea zone containing only enemy
transports.
Chosen Last: Transports may only be chosen as a casualty if there are no other eligible units. Normally this will occur
when only transports are left, but it may also occur under other circumstances. For example, fi ghters attacking transports
and submerged submarines will hit the transports because they cannot hit the submarines.
Carry Land Units: A transport may carry land units belonging to you or to friendly powers. Its capacity is any one land
unit, plus one additional infantry. Thus, a full transport may carry a tank and an infantry, an artillery and an infantry, an
antiaircraft gun and an infantry, or two infantry. A transport cannot carry an industrial complex. Land units on a transport
are cargo; they cannot attack or defend while at sea and are destroyed if their transport is destroyed.
Land units belonging to friendly powers must load on their controller’s turn, be carried on your turn, and offl oad on a later
turn of their controller.
Loading onto and/or offl oading from a transport counts as a land unit’s entire move; it cannot move before loading or after
offl oading. Place the lanits alongside the transport in the sea zone. If the transport moves in the Noncombat Move
phase, any number of units aboard may offl oad into a single friendly territory.
Loading and Offl oading: A transport can load cargo in friendly sea zones before, during, and after it moves. A transport
can pick up cargo, move one sea zone, pick up more cargo, move one more sea zone, and offl oad the cargo at the end of
its movement. It may also remain at sea with the cargo still aboard (but only if the cargo remaining aboard was loaded in a
previous turn or was loaded this turn in the Noncombat Move phase).
Whenever a transport offl oads, it cannot move again that turn. If a transport retreats, it cannot offl oad that turn. A transport
cannot offl oad in two territories during a single turn, nor can it offl oad cargo onto another transport. A transport cannot
load or offl oad while in a hostile sea zone. Remember that hostile sea zones contain enemy units, but that for purposes of
determining the status of a sea zone, submarines and transports are ignored.
A transport can load and offl oad units without moving from the friendly sea zone it is in (this is known as “bridging”).
Each such transport is still limited to its cargo capacity. It can offl oad in only one territory, and once it offl oads, it cannot
move, load, or offl oad again that turn.
Amphibious Assaults: A transport can take part in an amphibious assault step of the Conduct Combat phase. That is the
only time a transport can offl oad into a hostile territoDuring an amphibious assault, a transport must either offl oad all units that were loaded during the Combat Move phase or
retreat during sea combat. It may also offl oad any number of units owned by the transport’s power that already were on
board at the start of the turn.
