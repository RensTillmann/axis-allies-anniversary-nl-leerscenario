## Standard Format to Apply:
```json
{
  "round": X,
  "turn": Y,
  "player": "Nation Name",
  "phase": "round_X_turn_Y_phase_Z",
  "phase_name": "Phase Name",
  "date": "Historical Date",
  "action": "Description"
}
```

## Phase Names:
- Phase 1: Research & Development
- Phase 2: Purchase Units
- Phase 3: Combat Move
- Phase 4: Conduct Combat
- Phase 5: Noncombat Move
- Phase 6: Mobilize New Units
- Phase 7: Collect Income

## Strategy for Remaining Chapters:
1. Identify all turns in each chapter
2. Assign proper round numbers (continuing from previous chapters)
3. Assign proper turn numbers based on 1941 turn order
4. Ensure each player completes all phases before next player
5. Add missing phases where needed (especially income collection)

This systematic approach will ensure all chapters follow correct turn structure.
