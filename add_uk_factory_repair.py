Script to add UK factory repair action to campaign.json

This script will:
1. Find a suitable UK turn in Chapter 5 or 6
2. Add a factory repair action during Purchase Phase  
3. Deduct 4 IPC from UK's banked total
4. Remove the 4 damage markers
5. Restore UK production from 4 to 8 units
6. Include educational notes about repair mechanics
7. Update subsequent UK production to reflect restored capacity
