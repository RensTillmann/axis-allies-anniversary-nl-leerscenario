## üåÖ **Dawn of War - June 22, 1941, 04:30**

### **The Commandobunker, East Prussia**

*The largest military operation in world history is about to begin. 3.8 million soldiers, 3,350 tanks, 2,770 aircraft - all aimed at one goal: the destruction of the Soviet Union.*

In the dim glow of the command bunker maps, **Generaloberst Heinz Guderian** stares at the Polish frontier while his adjutant reads the latest radio reports. The panzer divisions are ready for breakthrough - 350 tanks, thousands of infantry, all waiting for his command.

**Adjutant:** "Herr General, Field Marshal von Bock demands maximum speed. All reserves must advance - no unit may remain behind for defense."

**Guderian:** "All Panzer Groups: Forward! Maximum speed! Let nothing slow the advance! Stalin doesn't expect us - we must destroy him before he can react!"

**Guderian:** "All units - COMPLETELY forward. We leave nothing behind. The Soviet state will collapse like a house of cards."

*Guderian's private thoughts: Speed has always been my doctrine. In France, it brought us victory in six weeks. In Poland, we crushed resistance in days. Russia may be vast, but speed and superior technology will overcome numbers. It always has.*

## üéÆ **Your First Turn: German Combat Move Phase**

**Date:** June 22, 1941, 04:30  
**Phase:** Round 1, Turn 1, Phase 3 - Combat Move

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION REQUIRED:**

1. **Locate on your board:**
   - **Poland territory** (German-controlled)
   - **East Poland territory** (Soviet-controlled)

2. **Count your German units in Poland:**
   - 4 Infantry pieces
   - 2 Tank pieces  
   - 1 Artillery piece

3. **Execute Guderian's orders - Move ALL units:**
   - Pick up ALL 7 units from Poland
   - Place them adjacent to East Poland (they will attack next phase)
   - **CRITICAL:** Leave Poland completely empty

---

### üéì **RULE TUTORIAL: Movement Phase**

**Movement Basics:**
- **Infantry:** Move 1 territory
- **Tanks:** Move 2 territories 
- **Artillery:** Move 1 territory

**Combat Movement Rules:**
- Units moving to attack must stop when they reach an enemy-occupied territory
- You can move multiple units to attack the same territory
- Once you move a unit toward combat, you MUST attack

**‚ö†Ô∏è Strategic Error Alert:**
Notice that Poland is now **completely undefended**. Is this wise? Guderian believes speed matters more than security, but we'll see...

## ‚öîÔ∏è **The Battle for East Poland - 05:00**

### **Combat Phase Begins**

The German war machine crashes into the surprised Soviet border guards. The thunder of tank engines and artillery echoes across the Polish countryside.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION REQUIRED: Conduct Combat**

**Location:** East Poland  
**Attackers:** Your 7 German units  
**Defenders:** 2 Soviet Infantry pieces

### üéì **RULE TUTORIAL: Combat Resolution**

**Step 1: Artillery Support**
- Artillery gives +1 attack to ONE infantry unit
- Choose 1 of your infantry to receive this bonus
- That infantry attacks at **2** instead of **1**

**Step 2: Roll Attack Dice**
- Infantry (normal): Attack on 1 (1 die)
- Infantry (artillery supported): Attack on 1-2 (1 die) 
- Tank: Attack on 1-3 (1 die each)
- Artillery: Attack on 1-2 (1 die)
- **Total:** Roll 7 dice for German attack

**Step 3: Count Hits**
The historical dice results were: **2, 1, 4, 3, 3, 5, 2**
- Infantry (supported): **2** = HIT! ‚úÖ
- Infantry: **1** = HIT! ‚úÖ  
- Infantry: **4** = x
- Infantry: **3** = x
- Tank: **3** = HIT! ‚úÖ
- Tank: **5** = x
- Artillery: **2** = HIT! ‚úÖ

**German Hits: 4**

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION: Apply Casualties**

**Soviet Response:**
- Only 2 Soviet infantry defend
- 4 German hits vs 2 Soviet units = **All Soviet units destroyed**
- Remove both Soviet infantry from East Poland

**German Casualties:** None (Soviets had no attack dice)

---

### üéì **RULE TUTORIAL: Territory Capture**

**When you win a battle:**
1. **Remove all defending units**
2. **Move your attacking units into the territory**
3. **Place your control marker** (or flip territory marker)
4. **Update income values** (East Poland worth +2 IPC to Germany)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION: Update the Board**
- Move all 7 German units into East Poland
- Place German control marker on East Poland
- Remove Soviet control marker

---

## üí∞ **Income Collection - End of German Turn**

**Date:** June 22, 1941, 18:00  
**Phase:** Round 1, Turn 1, Phase 7 - Collect Income

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION: Calculate German Income**

**German territories now controlled:**
- Starting territories: 31 IPC value
- East Poland: +2 IPC value
- **Total:** 33 IPC

### üéì **RULE TUTORIAL: Income Collection**

**Income Collection Rules:**
- Each nation collects income **only on their own turn**
- Income = total IPC value of territories you control
- You collect at **end** of your turn (Phase 7)
- Money goes to your "bank" for next turn's purchases

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION: Collect Money**
- Take 33 IPC tokens from the bank
- Place them in your treasury
- Germany now has 33 IPC for future purchases

**Result:** Germany gained 2 IPC from conquering East Poland!

## üîÑ **The Soviet Response - June 23, 1941, 11:15**

### **The Kremlin War Room**

*While Army Group Center stormed eastward, something happened that many Wehrmacht commanders had not foreseen. In the rush to break through, a crucial military rule was forgotten...*

**Marshal Georgy Zhukov** storms into the meeting room, his uniform still dusty from frontline inspection. Stalin looks up from the maps showing the catastrophe in East Poland.

**Stalin:** "What is the situation, Georgy Konstantinovich?"

**Zhukov:** "Comrade Stalin, the German attack was massive - all units at once. But our scouts report something interesting..."

**Zhukov:** "They sent EVERYTHING forward. No reserves, no rear guard. Poland lies completely open."

**Stalin:** "Does this mean what I think it means?"

**Zhukov:** "Our 15th Regiment in Belorussia can punch straight through. If the Germans thought speed was more important than security... let us teach them otherwise."

**Stalin:** "–ù–µ–º–µ–¥–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ! (Immediately!) All available troops - recapture Poland. Let them learn that the Red Army is not defeated!"

## ‚ö° **Soviet Counter-Attack**

**Date:** June 23, 1941, 11:30  
**Player:** Soviet Union  
**Phase:** Round 1, Turn 2, Phase 3 - Combat Move

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION: Soviet Player's Move**

1. **Locate Belorussia territory** (Soviet-controlled)
2. **Count Soviet units:** 2 Infantry pieces
3. **Look at Poland:** Is it defended? **NO!** (Germany left it empty)
4. **Move Soviet units:** Move both infantry from Belorussia to Poland

### üéì **RULE TUTORIAL: Exploiting Undefended Territory**

**Undefended Territory Rules:**
- If territory has no defending units, attackers capture it automatically
- No dice rolling needed
- No combat phase required
- Move in and take control immediately

This is why leaving territories undefended is dangerous!

---

## üéØ **Automatic Victory**

**Date:** June 23, 1941, 11:45  
**Phase:** Conduct Combat (automatic)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION: Capture Poland**

**Soviet units entering Poland:**
- 2 Infantry pieces
- **No German defenders present**
- **Result:** Automatic Soviet victory!

### **Update the Board:**
1. Place 2 Soviet infantry in Poland
2. Remove German control marker
3. Place Soviet control marker on Poland
4. Leave Belorussia empty (units moved out)

### üéì **RULE TUTORIAL: Income Changes**

**When territory changes hands:**
- **Germany loses:** -2 IPC (Poland lost)
- **USSR gains:** +2 IPC (Poland recaptured)

**New income levels:**
- Germany: 31 IPC (back to starting level)
- USSR: 30 IPC (no net change from start)

---

## üí∞ **Soviet Income Collection**

**Date:** June 23, 1941, 20:00  
**Phase:** Soviet Collect Income

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION: Calculate Soviet Income**

**Soviet territories controlled:**
- Starting territories: 30 IPC base
- Lost East Poland: -2 IPC
- Gained Poland: +2 IPC
- **Total:** 30 IPC (net zero change)

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **ACTION: Collect Money**
- Take 30 IPC tokens from bank
- USSR treasury now has 30 IPC

---

## üìä **End of Chapter Results**

### **Territorial Changes:**
- **East Poland:** USSR ‚Üí Germany ‚úÖ
- **Poland:** Germany ‚Üí USSR ‚úÖ  
- **Belorussia:** No units remaining (weakened Soviet position)

### **Financial Summary:**
- **Germany:** Collected 33 IPC, now has 33 banked
- **USSR:** Collected 30 IPC, now has 30 banked
- **Net effect:** Germany +2 IPC advantage

### **Military Losses:**
- **USSR:** Lost 2 infantry (combat casualties in East Poland)
- **Germany:** No losses

---

## üéì **Strategic Lessons Learned**

### **‚úÖ Key Takeaway: "Never Leave Territory Undefended"**

**What happened:**
1. Germany achieved tactical success (captured East Poland)
2. But strategic error (left Poland undefended) 
3. USSR exploited the opening immediately
4. Germany's net gain was minimal despite "winning"

**The Mathematics:**
- Germany spent 1 full turn and took casualties to gain +2 IPC
- But Germany also lost 2 IPC the very next turn
- **Net result:** Very small advantage for significant risk

### **Historical Context:**
This mirrors the real challenges of Operation Barbarossa:
- Initial successes created overextension 
- Long supply lines became vulnerable
- Speed vs. security trade-offs had consequences
- The vastness of Russia absorbed German advantages

### **Game Mechanics Learned:**

‚úÖ **Movement Rules:** Different units have different movement ranges  
‚úÖ **Combat Resolution:** Dice rolling, artillery support, casualty assignment  
‚úÖ **Territory Control:** How conquest affects income and positioning  
‚úÖ **Income Collection:** When and how players gain resources  
‚úÖ **Turn Sequence:** How phases flow from player to player

## üéØ **Preparing for Chapter 2**

In the next chapter, you'll learn about:
- **Production Phase:** How to buy new units with your IPC
- **Industrial Philosophy:** Quality vs. Quantity strategies  
- **Factory Limitations:** Production capacity rules
- **Advanced Combat:** Multiple territory battles

The foundation you've built here - understanding movement, combat, and income - will serve you throughout your Axis & Allies journey.

**Remember Guderian's lesson:** In war, as in this game, speed without security can lead to costly vulnerabilities. Every move has consequences that ripple through future turns.
