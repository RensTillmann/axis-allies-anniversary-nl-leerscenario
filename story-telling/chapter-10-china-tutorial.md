*The map of China shows a patchwork of contested territories. General Stilwell meets with Chinese commanders to coordinate the resistance.*

## 📊 **Chinese Production Demonstration**

### **Current Chinese Holdings**

| Territory | Units Present | Can Place New Units? |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Yunnan | 3 Infantry + Flying Tigers | NO (at 3-unit max) |
| Szechwan | 2 Infantry | YES (1 more allowed) |
| Hupeh | 1 Infantry | YES (2 more allowed) |
| Suiyuan | 2 Infantry | YES (1 more allowed) |

**Production Calculation:**
- Territories Controlled: 4
- Formula: 4 ÷ 2 = **2 new infantry**
- Placement Decision: 1 to Szechwan, 1 to Hupeh

## ✈️ **The Flying Tigers**

### **America's Gift to China**

**Unit:** 1 US Fighter permanently assigned to China  
**Location:** Yunnan  
**Combat Values:** Attack 3, Defense 4

### **🎓 Special Rules:**

Chinese Losses: 2 Infantry
```

**🎓 Production Impact:**

## 🎓 **Mastering Chinese Strategy**

### **Key Strategic Principles**

1. **Every Territory Matters**
   - Direct impact on production
   - No IPC buffer to absorb losses

2. **Infantry Conservation**
   - Cannot purchase replacements
   - Each loss is permanent reduction

3. **Flying Tigers Doctrine**
   - Use sparingly - irreplaceable
   - Save for critical battles only

4. **Geographic Prison**
   - Work within movement limits
   - Cannot reinforce from outside

5. **Coordination Complexity**
   - Separate but supporting US operations
   - Defensive synergy, offensive independence
