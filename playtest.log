CHAPTER 3: AIR WARFARE EVOLUTION (December 1941)
===============================================

ROUND 3, TURN 1 (GERMANY)
Phase 3: Combat Move
✅ German fighters move to attack UK: 2 fighters
✅ Mission: Fighter sweep to eliminate RAF

Phase 4: Conduct Combat
✅ Combat at United Kingdom: 2 German fighters vs UK defenders
✅ UK Defenders: 2 inf, 1 art, 1 tank, 2 fighters, 1 bomber, 1 AA gun
✅ AA Gun Fire: Dice [3,2] = 0 hits (hits on 1 only)
✅ Air Combat: German [2,4] = 1 hit, UK defense [1,3,5,5,4,2,1,5] = 4 hits
✅ Casualties: 2 German fighters eliminated, 1 UK infantry eliminated
✅ Result: Pyrrhic German defeat

✅ Bombing Damage: Dice [4] = 4 damage markers placed
✅ UK Factory Status: 8 → 4 production capacity

❌ MATHEMATICAL ERROR FOUND:
- Germany banked total shows 54 IPC but calculation says "21 previous + 33 collected"
- Should be: 58 previous (from Chapter 2) - expenses + 33 collected
- Need to verify German expenses in Chapter 3

Phase 7: Collect Income  
❌ CALCULATION ISSUE:
✅ Territorial income: 33 (correct)
❌ Banked calculation inconsistent: shows 54 but previous should be higher

ROUND 3, TURN 4 (UNITED KINGDOM)
Phase 3: Combat Move
✅ RAF fighters move to attack Germany: 2 fighters  
✅ Same tactical error as Germans (educational lesson)

Phase 4: Conduct Combat
✅ Combat at Germany: 2 UK fighters vs German defenders
✅ German Defenders: 3 inf, 1 art, 2 tanks, 1 bomber, 1 AA gun
✅ AA Gun Fire: Dice [1,3] = 1 hit (1 UK fighter shot down)
✅ Air Combat: UK [3] = 1 hit, German defense = 1 hit
✅ Casualties: 2 UK fighters eliminated, 1 German AA gun eliminated
✅ Result: Mutual tactical failure

Phase 7: Collect Income
✅ UK territorial income: 43 (base income)
✅ IPC collected: 43
✅ Banked total: 43
⚠️  CRITICAL STRATEGIC ERROR: UK has 43 banked IPC but doesn't repair 4 damage markers (cost: 4 IPC)
⚠️  This will cost UK 4 units production capacity for remainder of campaign
⚠️  Over 6+ chapters, this represents 24+ units lost production

Chapter 3 End State Verification:
✅ Victory Cities: No changes (Axis 6, Allies 12)
❌ MATH ERROR: German banked shows 54 but should be ~91 (58 from Ch2 + 33 collected - no expenses shown)
✅ UK Factory Status: 4 damage markers (8 → 4 production capacity)
✅ Unit Losses: Germany -2 fighters -1 AA gun, UK -2 fighters -1 infantry
✅ Air Warfare Lesson: Both sides learn about unescorted operations
